It sets a high-level framework that influences the interpretation of all subsequent articles.\n\n2.  **Article 2 (Scope)** [pages 45-46]:  This article's broad scope ensures comprehensive coverage of the AI value chain within the EU, but also includes significant exclusions.  The exclusion for scientific R&D and the conditional exclusion for open-source AI are particularly notable. The interaction with existing EU law (e.g., GDPR, product safety legislation) is clarified.\n\n    - *Paragraph 1:* Specifies the entities subject to the regulation. \n    - *Paragraph 2:* Addresses AI systems that are high-risk AI systems in accordance with Article 6(1).\n    - *Paragraph 3:* Excludes areas like national security and AI systems used exclusively for military purposes.\n    - *Paragraph 4:* Excludes public authorities in a third country and international organisation when acting in the framework of international agreements.\n    - *Paragraph 5:* Ensures there is no affect on the provisions of liability of intermediary services as set out in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.\n    - *Paragraph 6:* Excludes AI systems developed solely for scientific research.\n    - *Paragraph 7:* Ensures existing Union law on the protection of personal data is applied.\n    - *Paragraph 8:* Excludes research, testing or development prior to placing the AI system on the market.\n    - *Paragraph 9:* Ensures there is no prejudice to consumer protection and product safety rules.\n    - *Paragraph 10:* Excludes AI systems used by natural persons during personal non-professional activity.\n    - *Paragraph 11:* Does not prevent more favourable provisions to protect worker's rights.\n    - *Paragraph 12:* Excludes free and open-source AI systems.\n\n3. **Article 3 (Definitions)** [pages 46-50]: The extensive list of definitions is crucial for consistent application of the regulation. The definition of 'AI system' itself is technology-neutral and based on a system's ability to infer and generate outputs.  The definitions of 'risk,' 'intended purpose,' and 'reasonably foreseeable misuse' are important for the risk-based approach. Distinctions between 'biometric identification,' 'biometric verification,' and 'biometric categorization' are essential for understanding the restrictions on biometric systems.  The concept of 'general-purpose AI model' is introduced, setting the stage for specific obligations later in the regulation.\n\n4. **Article 4 (AI literacy)** [page 51]: Establishes requirement of AI literacy."

The detailed provisions are critical for ensuring compliance:\n\n1.  **Manipulative and Exploitative Techniques (Article 5(1)(a) and (b))**:  The prohibition covers systems that impair informed decision-making and exploit vulnerabilities. The concept of 'significant harm' is key, encompassing physical, psychological, and financial damage.\n\n2.  **Social Scoring (Article 5(1)(c))**: This prohibition addresses the risk of AI-driven discrimination and unfair treatment based on social behavior or personal characteristics. It distinguishes between legitimate evaluations for specific purposes and unacceptable general-purpose social scoring.\n\n3.  **Predictive Policing (Article 5(1)(d))**: The ban focuses on systems that predict *solely* based on profiling, not affecting systems that support human assessment based on objective facts.\n\n4.  **Facial Recognition Databases (Article 5(1)(e))**: This prohibition targets the indiscriminate creation and expansion of facial recognition databases from online sources or CCTV footage, due to privacy concerns.\n\n5.  **Emotion Recognition (Article 5(1)(f))**:  This ban addresses the use of AI to infer emotions in workplaces and education, recognizing the potential for intrusion and discrimination, with exceptions for medical and safety applications.\n\n6.  **Biometric Categorisation (Article 5(1)(g))**:  The prohibition targets systems that categorize individuals based on sensitive attributes inferred from biometric data. Lawful labeling or filtering of biometric data in law enforcement is not covered.\n\n7.  **Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification (Article 5(1)(h))**: This is the most complex prohibition, allowing limited exceptions for law enforcement under strict conditions of necessity and proportionality. The exceptions are narrowly defined (searching for victims, preventing terrorist attacks, identifying suspects of serious crimes).  The subsequent paragraphs (2-7) specify safeguards, authorization requirements, and reporting obligations for any use of such systems.  Member States can adopt stricter national laws."

        "heading": "High-risk AI System Requirements and Obligations",
        "content": "Chapter III provides the core operational requirements for high-risk AI systems. Key aspects include:\n\n1.  **Classification (Section 1)** [pages 53-55]:\n    - **Article 6** [pages 53-54]: High-risk classification is based on two primary criteria: (1) being a safety component of a product (or the product itself) covered by existing EU harmonisation legislation requiring third-party conformity assessment (listed in Annex I), and (2) being listed in Annex III. The conditions under which an AI system is not to be considered high-risk are defined. The Commission will give guidance no later than 2 February 2026.\n    - **Article 7** [pages 54-55]: Provides for amendments to Annex III via delegated acts, adding or modifying use-cases based on risk criteria.\n\n2.  **Requirements (Section 2)** [pages 55-61]:\n    - **Article 9 (Risk management system)** [pages 56-57]: This is a central requirement, mandating a continuous, iterative process throughout the AI system's lifecycle. It includes risk identification, analysis, evaluation, and mitigation.\n    - **Article 10 (Data and data governance)** [pages 57-58]: This article is critical for data-driven AI. It mandates high-quality data sets for training, validation, and testing, emphasizing relevance, representativeness, completeness, and freedom from errors. It specifically addresses bias detection and correction, allowing for the processing of special categories of personal data under strict conditions.\n    - **Article 11 (Technical documentation)** [page 58]: This article outlines the extensive documentation requirements, detailed in Annex IV. This documentation must demonstrate compliance and enable assessment by authorities.\n    - **Article 13 (Transparency)** [pages 59-60]: This article aims to ensure that deployers can understand and use AI systems appropriately. It requires detailed instructions for use, including information on intended purpose, capabilities, limitations, performance metrics, and human oversight measures.\n    - **Article 14 (Human oversight)** [pages 60-61]: This article mandates that high-risk AI systems be designed for effective human oversight, preventing or minimizing risks. The measures must be proportionate to the risks and level of autonomy.\n    - **Article 15 (Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity)** [page 61]: This article establishes technical requirements for consistent performance and resilience against errors, faults, and malicious attacks.\n\n3.  **Obligations (Section 3)** [pages 62-70]: This section clearly allocates responsibilities:\n    - **Providers (Article 16)** [page 62]: Bear primary responsibility for ensuring compliance, implementing quality management, maintaining documentation, and handling conformity assessment. They must also cooperate with authorities and take corrective actions when necessary.\n    - **Authorised Representatives (Article 22)** [page 65]: Act on behalf of providers not established in the EU.\n    - **Importers (Article 23)** [pages 65-66]: Must verify compliance before placing AI systems on the market.\n    - **Distributors (Article 24)** [pages 66]: Also have verification responsibilities.\n    - **Article 25 (Responsibilities along the AI value chain)** [pages 67-68]: Defines when other parties become providers and inherit obligations. A written agreement is required between providers and third parties.\n    - **Deployers (Article 26)** [pages 67-69]: Must use systems according to instructions, assign human oversight, monitor operation, and keep logs. Specific obligations apply to financial institutions. They should provide information to workers who are subject to the use of the high-risk AI system. Deployers using post-remote biometric identification must request authorization for the use of such systems and document their usage.\n    - **Article 27 (Fundamental rights impact assessment)** [pages 69-70]: Requires certain deployers (bodies governed by public law, private entities providing public services, and deployers of specific high-risk AI systems like banking or insurance entities) to conduct a fundamental rights impact assessment *before* deploying a high-risk AI system. This assessment must identify specific risks, the period of use, categories of affected persons, and measures to mitigate risks. A notification to the market surveillance authority is required after the assessment. The AI Office will develop a template questionnaire to facilitate this process.\n\n4. **Notifying Authorities and Notified Bodies (Section 4)** [pages 70-76]: This section is less directly relevant to financial institutions, but it establishes the framework for third-party conformity assessment, which is required for some high-risk AI systems. It includes requirements for designating notifying authorities (Article 28) and for the notified bodies themselves (Articles 29-39).\n\n5.  **Standards, Conformity Assessment, Certificates, Registration (Section 5)** [pages 76-81]:\n - **Article 40 (Harmonised standards and standardisation deliverables)** [pages 76]:  This article links compliance with harmonized standards to a presumption of conformity with the regulation's requirements. It encourages the development of standards and standardisation with participation of various stakeholders.\n - **Article 43 (Conformity assessment)** [pages 78-79]:  This article is crucial. It outlines the conformity assessment procedures required for high-risk AI systems.  For systems related to products covered by existing EU harmonization legislation (Annex I), conformity assessment is integrated into existing procedures. For other high-risk AI systems (listed in Annex III, points 2-8), conformity assessment is generally based on internal control by the provider (Annex VI).  However, for AI systems used for biometrics (Annex III, point 1), a third-party conformity assessment involving a notified body (Annex VII) is required.\n - **Article 47 & 48 (EU declaration of conformity and CE marking)** [pages 80-81]:  These articles require providers to declare conformity and affix the CE marking to high-risk AI systems, indicating compliance with the regulation.\n - **Article 49 (Registration)** [pages 81]:  This article establishes the requirement for providers to register high-risk AI systems (with some exceptions) in an EU database, providing transparency and facilitating market surveillance."
